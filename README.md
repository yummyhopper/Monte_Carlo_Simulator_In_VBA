# Monte Carlo Simulator In Excel VBA

![Monte_Carlo_Simulator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f5ae384-eee1-4e52-b033-e386f2422515)


### Introduction

This is a Monte Carlo simulation tool I built using Excel VBA. It leverages a UserForm, called from a subroutine, to execute stochastic simulations based on user-defined inputs. The simulator is designed to estimate probabilistic outcomes for complex models, similar to Oracle's expensive Crystal Ball software.

Users can specify the number of iterations, define an input range (as a named range on Sheet1), and designate an output cell (also a named range on Sheet1) that contains a function to evaluate. The simulation supports exponential, normal, and unimodal distributions.

### Contents

- MonteCarlo_Simulator (Version 1).xlsm – Example Excel file containing all the VBA code with pre-configured named ranges.

### Skills + Tools Used

- Excel VBA – For implementing Monte Carlo logic and UserForm handling.
- UserForms – For interactive input selection.
- Probability Distributions – Exponential, Normal, and Unimodal.
- Named Ranges – To dynamically reference input and output cells.
- Iterative Computation – Running simulations over thousands of trials.

This tool enables robust Monte Carlo simulations in Excel, bringing advanced probabilistic analysis without the hefty cost of enterprise solutions.
